# AppleScript Tools

Just a few AppleScript tools that I personally find useful to automate my day to day tasks on the Mac.

## How to run these scripts
(_Note: These steps have been tested on macOS Mojave 10.14.6_
* Open the script in Script Editor
* File -> Export
* Select "Application" from the File Format dropdown
* Hit "Save"
* You'll end up with a `.app` file, which you can run by double-clicking or selecting from Spotlight Search
* If you're feeling ambitious, you can add a nicer icon to the app file. To do this, bring up the Info window (Command+I or File -> Get Info or 2-finger-tap -> Get Info) and drag any `.icns` file over the preview image in the top-left corner. You can find pretty much any ICNS file at https://icon-icons.com (or just do your own Google search).
